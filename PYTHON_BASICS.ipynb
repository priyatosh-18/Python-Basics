        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        " - Python is a high level programiing language specially known for is easiness to use and is interpretable.\n",
        " - It is popular because it has vast community support and libraries, it supports multiple paridigm of (object oriented, functional and procedural programming),and also python supports dynamic types.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "  - Interpreter directly reads and executes the code sequentially in python.\n",
        "  - It is like compiler of other languages but it do not convert the code to machine readable language, it directly intepretes and execute thats why pyhton is an interpretable language.\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        " - These are those words in python which have a fixed function or special meaning in python and these words cannot be used as variable to store data.    \n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
        " - No, predefined keywords cannot be used as variable names to store data.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python\n",
        " - mutability refers to the ability to change/update a data type in python.\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        " - lists are mutable because we require lists for flexibility, for altering any data in it.\n",
        " - whereas tuples are unmutuable because we need it for accessing the data much faster and since they are used to represent a fixed set of data, they can be easily accesed by their memory address in the system.\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
        "- both are comparison operators but == is an equality operator while 'is' is an identity operator which not only checks if both data types are same but also checks their memory address.\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python\n",
        " - those operators which are used to combine conditional statements of if, elif and while.\n",
        " - logical operators are 'and', 'or' and 'not' present in python.\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python\n",
        " - Typecasting refers to data type conversion in python across various data types such as int to float, float to string, int to boolean and vice versa and many more.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        " - when no external function is required to convert the data from one data type to another, it is called implicit.\n",
        " - e.g. conversion of int to float \n",
        " - when an external function is required to convert one data type to another, it is called explicit typecasting.\n",
        " - e.g. conversion from string to int/float"

        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
        " - The primary purpose of conditional statements in Python is to enable decision-making in your code. They allow a program to execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition is True or False.\n",
        " - Without conditional statements, a program would simply run from top to bottom, executing the same lines of code every time. Conditional statements introduce dynamic behavior, allowing your program to react to different inputs, handle various scenarios, and create logical pathways.\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work\n",
        " - the elif must always follow an if statement.It allows to check for a new condition if the initial 'if' turns out to be False.\n",
        " - first it checks the if statement, and if that 'if' statement is true, the code is executed there and python blocks the elif.\n",
        " - if that 'if' statement turns out to be false, python moves to elif condition and checks whether that is true or not. If the elif is true, code is executed and if it is false, python continues to next elif till the true condition is met or till the end of chain.\n",
        " - when all 'if' and 'elif' are false, else command is executed at the end.\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        " - 'for' loop is used when you know the number of iterations or are iterating over a fixed collection.\n",
        " - 'while' loop is used when you need to repeat an action until a specific condition is met.\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "- A great scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop is when you are writing a program that needs to repeatedly ask for user input until a valid response is received.\n",
        "- For instance, imagine you're creating a simple quiz game. You want to ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 10. You don't know how many attempts the user will need to get the correct answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s why a while loop is the better choice:\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Indefinite Iteration: The number of times the user needs to guess is unknown. A while loop is perfect for this because it will continue to run \"while\" the guess is incorrect. You can set the condition to something like while guess != correct_answer:.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. Condition-Based Exit: The loop's termination depends entirely on the user's input. The loop stops as soon as the user enters the correct number. A for loop, on the other hand, would require you to pre-define the number of attempts (e.g., for attempt in range(5):), which isn't ideal because you want the user to be able to guess as many times as they need. .\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the while loop's ability to run until a specific, unpredictable condition is met makes it the more logical and flexible choice."
